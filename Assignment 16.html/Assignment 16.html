    <h3>About Thomas</h3>
    <div><p>Thomas is a blue steam engine and has a number 1 painted on his side. All of the locomotives in The Railway Series were based on prototypical engines; Thomas has origins in a cast metal 0-6-0 tank locomotive made by Stewart Reidpath (Essar, or S-R) in 1946. This locomotive was not based on the LB&SCR E2 class as once believed and portrayed by Hornby, but appears to be based on an LMS Fowler 0-6-0T (Jinty).[citation needed] Thomas first appeared in 1946 in the second book in the series, Thomas the Tank Engine, and was the focus of the four short stories contained within. Thomas's best friends are Percy and Toby.</p></div>

    <h3>Thomas and His Friends</h3>
    <div><p> The name of <span>Thomas</span> friends are: <span>Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, Percy, Toby and Diesel</span>. The story begins in 1917 in the sleepy village of Box in Wiltshire, England. A young boy lies awake in his bed, listening to steam engines huffing and puffing along the nearby Great Western Railway. To the little boy tucked up in bed, listening to the engines, it sounds very much like the trains are talking to each other. The young boy is Wilbert Awdry – later to become the Reverend W. Awdry, the creator of "The Railway Series" and the most famous tank engine in the world — Thomas.</p></div>
