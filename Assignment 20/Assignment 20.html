        <h2>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT??</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js. <br><br> JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases. <br><br>JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.</p>
        <h2>WHAT IS USE OF JAVASCRIPT???</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript. <br><br>Javascript is very simple to learn as compared to other programming languages like java. Being one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, resources for javascript are easily available online and offline. <br><br>As you know that JavaScript is used for front-end development. But the thing which makes it more exciting is that it is used for developing server and server-side applications. With the help of Frameworks like Node.js, you can do complete Back-end Development or Server Side Scripting.</p>
