            <ul>
                <li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_cat">Bengal cat</a> is a domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cat_breeds">cats breed</a>  created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau, with the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). The breed name comes from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their Leopard Cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed which needs much exercise and play.</p></li>
                <li><p>The Bengal cat is a large, sleek and very muscular cat with a thick tail that is carried low. The Bengal cat's wild appearance is enhanced by its distinctive thick and luxurious spotted or marbled coat. Its broad head has small ears and pronounced whisker pads and its eyes are black rimmed and almond shaped. The tail is thick, tapering to a black tip. There is no other breed of cat which displays the gold or pearl dusting effect (glitter) found on some Bengal cats and can be very demanding because of high activity levels.</p></li>
                <li><p>The Bengal is revered for its beautiful coat and outgoing personality, but these cats aren't for casual pet owners. Bengals are smart and cunning animals that crave attention and are always exploring. A Bengal is a handful, but you can rest assured that life with one will never be boring. </p></li>
                <li><p>The first Bengals were created by breeding Asian leopard cats with domestic cats. While documentation of the hybrid reaches back as early as the 1800s, the breed was perfected in the 1980s by Jean Sugden Mill. Over time, breeders like Mill developed a cat that combined the beauty and grace of a wild, forest-dwelling cat with the temperament of a domestic cat.</p></li>
                <li><p>The threat of getting wet sends most cats clamoring for cover, but not the water-loving Bengal. These frisky felines will gladly drink right from the tap if allowed. A Bengal may even follow its owner into the shower or bathtub. If you prefer privacy when bathing, make sure to close your door and prepare for some serious meowing from your Bengal.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bengals are very vocal and can be loud when they want something. A Bengal will definitely let you know when it's time to eat or time to play, so before adopting one, make sure you're OK with a cat that demands conversation. All that said, Bengal meows can be quite adorable, expressive and fun to hear.</p></li>

        <div class="cat">History of Bengal Cats</div>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A Bengal cat is considered a hybrid breed. Bengals are not typically included in lists that exclude exotic or big cat breeds due to the fact that they are smaller, are accepted by several other organizations as a pure breed, and are bred consistently past three generations (the first three generations look and act the wildest). Licensing requirements for Bengal cats were removed in the United Kingdom in 2007.</p></li>
                <li><p>While there were previous attempts at breeding hybrids between African leopard cats (ALC) and domestic cats, the Bengal cat hybrids are credited to Jean Sudgen Mill in the 1970s. She acquired hybrids from Dr. Willard Centerwall who was breeding them at Loyola University to study their genetics. She bred the hybrids with domestic cats to produce a breed that had the personality of a domestic cat and an exotic look. Greg and Elizabeth Kent crossed African leopard cats with Egyptian maus to develop a line of Bengal cats as well.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bengals are best-loved for their wild-looking markings. Rosettes, marbling, spots, and stripes make up the leopard patterns that varying Bengals display but their official markings are only considered either spotted or marbled. The patterns are always outlined in black, chocolate, or grey/silver. The coat colors are called brown tabby (most common), seal sepia tabby, seal mink tabby, seal lynx point, black silver tabby, seal silver sepia tabby, seal silver mink tabby, and seal silver lynx point. All shades of brown to black make up the markings and the brown tabbies typically have white background fur on their whisker pads, chin, chest, abdomen, and inner legs.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bengal cats were first recognized as an experimental breed by TICA in 1983 and received full recognition in 1993. The Bengal cat gained breed recognition by the Cat Fancier's Association in 2016. They are also recognized for registration by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association, the United Feline Organizations, and the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.</p></li>
