    <h3>Weenie the Dog</h3></div>
    <p>Like most pets, Weenie is loyal and affectionate. She keeps Oswald focused and prevents him from getting carried away with an idea or a scheme. Weenie loves to play with a Frisbee or her favorite ball of yarn. She has her special dish to eat from, her special blanket to snuggle in, and her special bed to sleep in. Weenie only communicates in "bark-speak," making one of her favorite activities howling along with Oswald as he plays on his piano. Weenie will stick with Oswald through thick or thin, and is a great companion to him.</p>

    <h3>Henry the Penguin</h3>
    <p>Oswald's downstairs neighbor and best friend. Henry is a creature of habit in every way and usually shuns the idea of trying different things, though he can sometimes be persuaded otherwise. He does his best to maintain a rigid schedule, which includes taking care of his extensive spoon collection, ending every evening watching "Penguin Patrol", his favorite TV show, and doing the Penguin Polka before bedtime. Most of Henry's favorite foods are fish-flavored and he is a proven expert on snow. He has an identical cousin from the frozen north named Louie (voiced by Michael McKean), and on occasion speaks of an Aunt Arctica. His motto is "slow and steady". He always takes two (used to be three) marshmallows in his hot cocoa, saying "No more, no less." He is also hates getting wet.</p>


    <div class="daisy"><img src="images/Daisy.png" alt="" width="100">
    <h3>Daisy the Flower</h3></div>
    <p>Daisy is high-spirited and enthusiastic. She could be described as the polar opposite of Henry, who would rather stay inside and read the newspaper than go rollerskating. Daisy, however, loves all kinds of sports and outdoor activities. She is always ready for anything, and loves to say, "Golly tamale!"</p>
